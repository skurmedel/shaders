GLSL shaders
------------

This is a collection of pure GLSL shaders and functions I've written.

A significant chunk are "general purpose" functions that are commonly used.

## General purpose files (in some order of usefulness)

| Name                      | Description                                      |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| gamma_correct.glsl        | sRGB, Rec.709, Rec.2020 transfer functions.      |
| luma.glsl *(TBD)*         | sRGB, Rec.709 luminosity approximations.         |
| hsv.glsl *(TBD)*          | hsv-rgb, rgb-hsv functions, for HSV colour space |
| simple_tonecurve.glsl     | A fix. 3 point tonecurve, for small grading      |

## Specific stuff (in order of "cool")
